description: |
    The capacity of quantum channels has not been stablished as good as classical channels, but for the case of coherent information restricitng to Gaussian inputs, the maximum is achieved when the input is in the form of thermal state. Thermal state can be created by adding infinite coherent state which in practice, is not attainable since both our systems and coding methods are finite-dimensional. This method developes a discrerization method to use a limited number of coherent state, a constellation, to replicate the thermal state to some extent. Having a finite-dimensional quantum setup, existing techniques for constructing well-performing codes can be applied. For example we can construct quantum polar codes that achieves the coherent information of thermal noise channel bound.

notes:
  - 'Thermal state and coherent state are to types of quantum states which photons can be in. Roughly speaking, thermal state have far from classical (electro-magnetic wave) behaviours of light and coherent states have similar behaviours.'
  - 'Since we are dealing with transmiting photons, the medium used is optical fibers.'
