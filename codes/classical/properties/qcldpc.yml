description: |
    An (N, J, K) binary code which its parity check matrix, H, has N columns, J ones in each column, K ones in each row and zeros elsewhere. This code can be built from a sparse bipartite graph (reffered to asTanner graph). 
    To build a code based on a bipartite graph, we can build the parity check matrix H. The nodes of one side of the bipartite graph will be the columns of H and nodes of the other side rows of H. if there is an edge from a node i in one side to a node j in the other side, H(i,j) = 1 and 0 otherwise.

features:

  rate: 'b/c. The rate (b/c) for this code comes close to the maximum of what channel allows (Shannon limit) as code size increases.'


  encoders:
    - 'Encoding complexity is of O(n) per symbol (which is good).'


realizations:
  - 'Satelite transmission of digital television, Wifi, 10GB Ethernet, 5G.'

notes: 
  - 'A code is said to be asymptotically good if its decoding is not complex and has a relatively good minimum distance with respect to its length (i.e. growth rate).'
