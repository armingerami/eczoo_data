name: 'Low Density Parity Check Codes'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:0805.0241}'


Description: |
    An (N, J, K) binary code which its parity check matrix, H, has N columns, J ones in each column, K ones in each row and zeros elsewhere. This code can be built from a sparse bipartite graph (reffered to asTanner graph). 
    To build a code based on a bipartite graph, we can build the parity check matrix H. The nodes of one side of the bipartite graph will be the columns of H and nodes of the other side rows of H. if there is an edge from a node i in one side to a node j in the other side, H(i,j) = 1 and 0 otherwise.

features:
  -  The rate (b/c) for this code comes close to the maximum of what channel allows (Shannon's limit) as code size increases.


  rate: 'b/c'


  encoders: 'Encoding complexity is of O(n) per symbol'

 

realizations: 'Satelite transmision of digital television, Wifi, 10GB Ethernet, 5G'

notes: 'A code is said to be asymptotically good if its decoding is not complex and has a relatively good minimum distance with respect to its length (i.e. growth rate).'
