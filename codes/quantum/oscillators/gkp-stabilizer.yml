description: |
    Generally speaking, there are two QEC schemes, qubit-into-oscillator encoding and oscillator-into-oscillator. Qubits are discrete variables while oscillators are continuous variables, meaning if we use qubit-into-oscillator encoding, we will lose the infinite-dimensional nature of the physical oscillator. On the other hand, using oscillator-into-oscillator encoding we encode an M dimensional oscillator into an N dimesional oscillator and therefore preserve the infinite-dimensional nature.
    GKP stabilizer codes are an oscillator-into-oscillator encdoing scheme which encodes an M-mode bosonic state, \ket{\psi}, into and N-mode one. The first M modes of the encoded state is \[U_G^{ENC}\] \ket{\psi} where \[U_G^{ENC}\] is an encoding Gaussian unitary operation and the other N - M modes are canonical GKP states (ancilla modes).

  # The fields below relate to specific properties of the code that are worth
  # noting. In some cases (see below), there might be multiple pieces of
  # information associated with a field (e.g., mutliple encoders/decoders,
  # multiple facts about fault tolerance, etc.); in such cases, the field
  # accepts a list of text entries, with one item per piece of information.

  threshold:
    - 'For M = 1, N = 2 and \[U_G^ENC\] = \[TS_{1,2}\] we have loss probability of at least 0.13\%, \[TS_{1,2}\] is the two-mode squeezing operation acting on the modes 1 and 2 with a gain â‰¥ 1.'


#realizations:
  # List and explain the different "domains" of realizations in list items.
  # Group closely related realizations into a single item. It's OK to have a
  # single list item. Each item should more or less correspond to what would be
  # said in a paragraph.

notes:
  - 'Since we have flexability over choosing \[U_G^ENC\] and it can be any Gaussian operator, GKP-stabilizer formalism is at least as flexible as the stabilizer formalism for qubit-based QEC which encompasses almost all conventional multi-qubit QEC schemes.'
